# Files_6502
Just trying to learn 6502 by creating my own programming language on it
 The assembly is based on 6502 emulator made by Nick Morgan using JavaScript , you can try the emultor available on easy 6502 blog site.
 If you want to follow along with your mobile apps, download "learn 6502" from google play store , i use that app too,it has its own editor ,asembler and emulator.


In browser version of 6502 Assembler the DEFINE function do not work properly, so please use the android app available otherwise code won't work.
